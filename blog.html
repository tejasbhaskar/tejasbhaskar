    Super smart ways to raise your quotient.

    If you google Emotional Quotient (EQ), the search engine giant will throw some very sophisticated, 
    ‘padha likha’ definitions at you. Might just end up challenging your IQ as well. Don’t even get into all that.
     There might be many complicated things in life; understanding and figuring out simple, 
  doable & smart ways to raise your emotional quotient should not be one of those headaches.
      Simply put, EQ is your ability to handle all the shit life throws at you,
       without losing your own calm and composure. Emotions are what makes us
        human (although there are pets in some homes who display more truer emotions these days than the owners). 
        The word ‘Emotion’ stands for ‘Energy in Motion’
         :-Hence there lies huge value in staying truthful about your emotions and using your mind and emotions in your favor and not against your own self

<h3>How to convert your content into popular blogs ?</h3>
<h3>My Learnings :-</h3>
<h4>Majority of these Blogs come from my personal experience. And from the collective experiences of the people (youth) who write to me about their concerns and problems on my Social Media. If you wish to become a very good blogger on self-help, you do not need to read or write more. You need to begin to LIVE MORE. And understand India and Indian ways more deeply.
Start writing about what fascinates you and not merely about what is likely to become popular. No point writing what someone else could have written. Write as if your audience is very smart and as if your readers have very little time. This will infuse brevity and creativity into your blog writings.
Writing helps one in so many other ways too e.g. it helps me clarify my own mind. When I blog about things, I thought I was very sure about' I realize how unsure I am in reality. Having such a clear mind is a super power in these hyper distracted times.
My blogs are primarily on Self-help. But a few of my blogs on Relationships, Leadership, Time management, Communication skills, English Grammar & Vocabulary had 2 million plus unique views. Most Popular Blogs
After blogging for some 10 years continuously I took a small break. Now I do not intend to write long form content. Just micro-blogs on self-help. Also, motivational blogs in Hindi too.
HERE is my detailed write up on ‘How to start a Blog and make it very popular
